# Website of the workshop series on Natural Logic Meets Machine Learning (NALOMA) 

The site uses TXT template from HTML5UP.  
`index.html` redirects to `index.html` of the corresponding year's iteration of the workshop.
Each iteration has its directory. This allows full flexibility such as changing a style or even a template for each iteration
and also decreases the chances of having dead links.
